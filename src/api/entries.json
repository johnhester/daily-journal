It serves as a highly functional repository for code that allows users to code in teams while keeping active workspaces separate from one another. Yet users are not only able to merge their individual branches of code into the project master, but they are able to pull down and review their coworkers' branches before approving the merge and vice versa. This only scratches the surface of Github's capabilities, but it's a good enough start.",
